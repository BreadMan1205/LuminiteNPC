Luminite NPC adds a town NPC that sells luminite, lunar fragments and super healing potions.
It doesn't have a proper sprite, sorry.

You need at least 1 luminite bar in your inventory for it to spawn.

Changelog:

1.2: Added more SoA support (fragments of blight and hatred, post-Araghur only)

1.1: Added Shadows of Abaddon support (quasar fragments)
